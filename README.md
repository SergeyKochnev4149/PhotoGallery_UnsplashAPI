App parse info from https://unsplash.com and then create activity with list of images and their decription. When we click on image, created new activity where image open in full screen size

When I started writing this app, I knew nothing about Android development. After spending about 50 hours, I realized:
How to create applications for android
What are View and their attributes. Also, how to create them programmatically, not in XML.
I learned what activities are, the transitions between them, and their life cycle.
How to set an image in an ImageView or ImageButton
How to work with buttons so that they perform actions when pressed
How to parse API information in JSON format and wrap them
How to get a photo by URL

I continue to learn every day
